# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to display data from the latest earthquakes occurring anywhere around the world as reported by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)  on an informative and easy-to-use interactive map display for the Disaster Reporting Network.  This project utilizes Leaflet and Mapbox to display different map styles.  The earthquake data is displayed with a sub-category showing just the major earthquakes registering a 4.5 or greater magnitude.  Finally, the tectonic plate boundary lines are also displayed on the map to illustrate the relationship between seismic activity and tectonic plates.

The map is interactive with three different map styles (Streets, Satellite, and Dark) and the layers for the tectonic plates, earthquake markers, and major earthquake markers are individually selectable.
